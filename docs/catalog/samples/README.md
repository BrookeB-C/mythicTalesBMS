# Catalog Sample Recipes

Three BeerXML recipes ready for import testing:

- `mythictales-citrus-ipa.xml` — hop-forward American IPA with citrus adjuncts.
- `mythictales-midnight-stout.xml` — lactose-enhanced foreign extra stout with cacao.
- `mythictales-golden-pils.xml` — clean German-style pilsner with step mash schedule.

Use these files to validate the catalog importer (`POST /api/v1/catalog/recipes/import`) or to demo recipe management flows.
