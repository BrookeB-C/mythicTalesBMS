# Product Manager — Initial Task List

Scope: Roadmap, backlog clarity, acceptance criteria, docs, release notes, and demo assets.

## P0 — Clarity & Readiness
- Tighten acceptance criteria for Priority 0 items in `000-technical-backlog.md`.
- Draft Problem JSON guide for user‑visible errors (align with API design).
- Create a standard AC template (`docs/templates/acceptance-criteria.md`).

## P1 — Docs & Release Notes
- Start a CHANGELOG or release notes in `docs/releases/` for the current sprint.
- Add user‑facing feature docs for Taproom Ops basics (Tap, Pour, Blow, Untap).
- Provide sample CSV/XML files and brief README under `src/main/resources/samples/`.

## P2 — Roadmap & UX Notes
- Produce a 2‑sprint roadmap outline with risks and dependencies.
- Collect UX notes for Big‑Board mode and projections (read‑only board, refresh cadence).

Done Criteria
- AC exist and are testable; linked from reviewed PRs.
- Release notes capture shipped changes with links to PRs.
- Docs are discoverable from `docs/codebase-overview.md`.
