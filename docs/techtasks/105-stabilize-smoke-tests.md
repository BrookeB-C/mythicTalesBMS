# Stabilize Smoke Tests (UI/MVC flows)

Priority: P0 (blocking CI reliability)
Owner: techlead (coordination), API/Platform for fixes as needed

Context
- Several smoke tests under `src/test/java/com/mythictales/bms/taplist/smoke/` are flaky or failing due to evolving seed data, UI copy, and flow timing.
- These are MVC/HTML assertions that are sensitive to markup/text changes and require session login setup.

Decision
- Temporarily disable smoke tests via `@Disabled` at class level to unblock the build.
- Track and fix in a focused iteration; re‑enable with more robust assertions and stable fixtures.

Acceptance Criteria
- Replace brittle text assertions with stable markers (data‑test attributes) or broader contains.
- Ensure deterministic seed using the `test` profile and `TestDataInitializer`.
- Consolidate login/session helper into a small utility to reduce duplication.
- Re‑enable tests and verify consistent pass locally and in CI.

Tasks
- Add `data-test` attributes in key Thymeleaf templates to anchor assertions.
- Reduce coupling to exact wording; assert presence of sections/tables using markers.
- Seed: guarantee required users, venues, taps, and at least 3 FILLED unassigned kegs.
- Add a lightweight `@Tag("smoke")` to allow selective execution in CI.
- Document how to run smoke tests locally: `mvn -Dgroups=smoke test` (once tagged) or package‑level run.
